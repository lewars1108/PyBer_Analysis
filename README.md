# PyBer_Analysis


**Overview**

The overview of this analysis is to perform exploratory analysis on data received from Pyber, a Python-based ride-sharing app. Our task is to create several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. More specifically, we need to show the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders. Percentages of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city also need to be included. Our results will help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine afordability for underserved neighborhoods.


**Results**

The pie charts below show a consistent pattern across the board with the "Urban" city type holding the majority of the total rides, drivers, and fares. Generally public transportation is used more frequently in urban areas where driving is more of an inconvenience. The "Rural" city type held the least amount of total rides, drivers, and fares. This could also be assumed based on the population and size of rural areas, where vehicles are practically a necessity.

**Summary**

To increase the numbers in the "Rural" cities, I would suggest offering drivers more incentive to want to drive for Pyber. It would also be beneficial to spend some of the marketing budgets to get the word out that this service is available to them. To account for the hesitation of the value and the cost of fares, it may be a good idea to throw in some promotions such as, "First Five Rides Free" or offer memberships that have flat rates with limits on miles per month.
